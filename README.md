# 8px-css-grid
When I first started to use frameworks like Bootstrap, I really didn't understand their purpose. There were no order, no composition, no layout. Except the 12 column grid solution which - till today - I can't solve it's essence.
So, I wrote this little css thing. 

- Everything is dividable by 8, so there are no half pixels.
- Much easier to design with it in apps like Figma or Sketch.
- There is no more "move by 1px".
- It's predictible.
